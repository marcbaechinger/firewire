# firewire

This is a first application made with node.js for my convenience reasons. As it's basically a static HTML app it easy to pull it out on othe http platforms.

## Install and run

install decent node js version: <i>https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation</i><br/>
(on mac I would go for homebrew)
	
<pre><code># git clone git@github.com:marcbaechinger/firewire.git
# cd firewire
# npm install
# node app.js
</code></pre>

The Frontend of the application is split up in 4 single page applications:

The main game screen taking webcam pictures: http://localhost:3000/gameapp/index.html 
The second screen game app to start a game in the main screen (iPad optimized): http://localhost:3000/pushbuttonapp/index.html
An auxiliary screen displaying the ranking of the played games: http://localhost:3000/resultapp/index.html
